## Design a fully functional credit card input field component.

> Features implemented:

-  User must be able to paste not more than 16 digit number which must be equally divided into 4 input fields with a submit button.
-  On pasting from the clipboard, the last input field should get in focus.
-  After adding 4 digits the focus should automatically move to the next input box. Same should happen during deletion.
-  The input field must be keyboard accessible.
-  On pressing enter or submit card number should be displayed in a list with a delete option.

### Build the reusable component. That can make the number of input boxes and the digits it can accept dynamically.
